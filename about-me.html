      <h2 id="self-taught">Self-Taught Coder</h2>
      <p id="info">I received a bachelors degree in mathematics from the University of Oklahoma. After graduation I knew I didnâ€™t want to be a teacher so I worked in the banking industry for a couple years. I was good at it but it was boring and mundane. So I switched industries and went to work in the the oil and gas industry at Chesapeake Energy in Oklahoma City. It allowed me to use my critical thinking and problem solving skills, which I liked.</p>
      <p id="info">Then, in October 2012, I discovered coding and my life turned upside down. At Chesapeake, along with two co-workers, I was charged to create something that would allow our team to best optimize long-term scheduling of oil well operations. One of my co-workers had some simple knowledge of VBA code in Excel, so I dissected what he had done and built my first macro. I was hooked! I suddenly realized the potential benefit software code could have on our project. Over the next 13 months I taught myself to code VBA and built an entire program with over 6,500 lines of my unique code. My program saved my team $80,000 in trackable costs every week! [For more detailed information on my program, hit up my LinkedIn profile.]</p>
      <p id="info">I have a new passion in life: coding. VBA was the first stepping stone on my journey. I have since started learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in my free time on the web. I have learned so much in a short amount of time but I have realized I need expert help in order to begin a career as a software engineer. My immediate future plans include applying to and attending a software engineering bootcamp in San Francisco. My ultimate goal is to be a software engineer in Silicon Valley and of course change the world.</p>
